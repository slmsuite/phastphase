This page provides an auto-generated summary of the internals of |fastphaseretrieval|_'s API
outside of the :meth:`~fastphaseretrieval.retrieve()` function.
The general user should not need to look at these internals.
You can find the source on `GitHub <https://github.com/slmsuite/fastphaseretrieval>`_.

Self-contained algorithms used for steps of retrieval are partially separated into their
own files.
